# Diagonal IRS optimization

## Versions:
    # 20250303: 
        # Added:
            # Code of Nacho for Non-orthogonal SISO is translated from Matlab to Python.
            # The script SampleGeneration.py is used to generate samples for the training of 
                the neural network. The best performance are obtained when generating all the
                samples from a single setup.
            # The script functionsNN.py include:
                - Class for NN. The training method includes the options for supervised and 
                    self-supervised learning.
                - Classes for the datasets. Datasets for supervised and self-supervised learning
                    are created with the samples generated by SampleGeneration.py.
            # The script Training.py is used to train the neural network. The training is done
                with the samples generated by SampleGeneration.py.
            # The script main.py is used to evaluate the NN models trained and compare them
                with the results of the optimization algorithms.
        # Results:
            # The results from the NN are competitive if compared to the optimization algorithms 
                when evaluated in serveral random setups with random realizations:
                - SDR = 14.99
                - NN supervised = 14.50 (Model_M_32_K_5_setups_1_realiz_200000_supervised_Epochs_5_NN1_0.0001.pt)
                - NN self-supervised = 14.52 (Model_M_32_K_5_setups_1_realiz_200000_self_supervised_Epochs_5_NN1_0.0001.pt)
                - NN superv+self-superv = 14.60 (Model_M_32_K_5_setups_1_realiz_200000_self_supervised_Epochs_5_NN1_1e-05.pt)
            # The self-supervised dataset with 2x10^6 couldn't be used due to memory limitations.

    # To do:
        - Extend to Beyond Diagonal IRS optimization.
